   pangtext1: "Pangolins are mostly solitary creatures, however, when they produce offspring, they stay together and raise it for about two years. Mother pangolins usually give birth to only one offspring. She remains in the burrow with the child for the first several weeks, protecting it if she senses danger.",
   pangtext2: "After the baby stops being so vulnerable, the mother exits the burrow and introduces the small pangolin to the world as it rides on its mom's back. They mostly move at night as they are nocturnal animals.",
   pangtext3: "Several months after birth, pangolins start eating insects instead of being nurtured by the mother. Pangolins are generally insectivorous, sometimes known scaly ant-eaters due to their appearance. They can eat up to 200 grams of ants per day, which is why they are important regulators of termite populations.",
   pangtext4: "Pangolins do not have teeth. Instead, they use their strong claws to dig insect routes and tear into vegetation to find food, after which they use their long tongues to lick up bugs. Their tongues are sticky so ants can't escape. As they don't have teeth, they also cannot chew and instead swallow small stones which then grind the food in a special part of their stomach.",
   pangtext5: "As you may have already noticed, pangolins are peculiar looking creatures. They are covered in scales! In fact, they are the only mammal to have that such skin. The scales are soft when pangolins are born and harden over time. These scales allow pangolins to roll up in a ball that would be hard from the outside, which protects them if predators appear.",
   pangtext6: "Scales make pangolins really beautiful, but unfortunately they are also the reason why these creatures are in great danger. Pangolins are estimated to be the most trafficked mammal. Their scales are used in traditional medicine due to the various medical traits they are believed to contain. Pangolin meat is also known to be a delicacy in parts of China and Vietnam.",
   pangtext7: "Tons of pangolin scales are illegally traded, which thus results thousands of dead pangolins. There are only 8 species of pangolins exisiting, and it is important to protect them, since entire communties depend on pangolins limiting the amount of insects and termites.",
