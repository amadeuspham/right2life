    title: "Be a savvy tourist",
    body: "While abroad, be conscious of places that may be advertising experiences with animals that could be linked to wildlife trafficking or partaking in photographs which could inadvertently promote the trafficking of wildlife. Selfies with tigers, loris, monkeys, parrots, leopard cats, orangutans or bears which are sometimes used to attract tourists should also be avoided, as these animals could be obtained from the wild."

    title: "Buy sustainably sourced products",
    body: "Be a responsible consumer and stick to products with transparent and ethical supply chains. Whenever buying any products made from wood ensure the wood has been harvested ethically and sustainably, for example by checking they are FSC certified. The illegal timber trade is worth billions of pounds a year. Illegal and highly destructive deforestation drives biodiversity decline and enables wildlife poaching and trafficking. Try to ensure products that contain palm oil do so from sustainable RSPO certified sources and only buy fish from sustainable sources whose supply chain can be tracked from its origin to sales point.The Good Fish Guide can help you select sustainable sea food, and the Giki app is a useful way to check the ethical standards of products."

    title: "Say NO to endangered and exotic animal products",
    body: "Be aware and avoid buying products derived from wildlife, plants, or other items made from them, online or in stores, even if legal within the country of origin. Items mistakenly bought in good faith include feathers from exotic birds, tortoise shell products, ivory products, products made from big cat species (such as jewellery made from canines, claws, skins), cacti, sea turtle shells, corals in jewellery and wild orchids. Sadly, this is by no means a comprehensive list. When in doubt ask where it has come from and for documentation proving legality. "

    title: "Avoid bizarre ‘delicatessen’",
    body: "When abroad it is tempting to order the bizarre or the extraordinary for the sake of an anecdote or out of simple curiosity. Think carefully before you do. Avoid, for example, ordering shark fin soup, swallow nest soup, drinking tiger bone wine, or any drink infused with animal or plant parts or products. Exotic wild meats such as Chinese giant salamander, snakes, songbirds, monkey, turtle or tortoise should also not be on your holiday menu."

    title: "Choose the right pet",
    body: "When purchasing pets be aware that Europe and the US are major demand markets for trafficked animals for the pet trade. Populations of certain amphibians, snakes, lizards, tarantulas, beetles, parrots, songbirds, and more, have been and continue to be impacted by illegal and unsustainable removal from the wild. Ensure you can confirm that what you are buying comes from a respected and captive bred certified stock. Even then, be aware that the species could be rare in the wild."

    title: "Report the crime",
    body: "Report suspected evidence of illegal wildlife trade to the National Wildlife Crime Unit NWCU. Never buy suspected illegal parts and products of wildlife as evidence as you could be prosecuted, and it only perpetuates demand."
